# Flight Delay Prediction Using Vertex AI on Google Cloud Platform

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight delays using advanced machine learning techniques deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Leveraging GCP's powerful services such as Vertex AI, BigQuery, Docker, and TensorFlow, I aim to build a scalable and reliable model for predicting flight delays accurately.

## Key Technologies Utilized
- **Vertex AI:** Vertex AI is utilized for model training, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment. Its managed services streamline the machine learning workflow, allowing me to focus on model development.
  
- **BigQuery:** Google BigQuery is used for data preprocessing and exploration. Its high-performance SQL queries enable me to analyze large datasets efficiently and derive valuable insights.

- **Docker:** Docker containers are employed to package the trained machine learning model for deployment. This ensures consistent and reproducible environments across different deployment platforms.

- **TensorFlow:** TensorFlow and Keras are utilized for model development. I leverage TensorFlow's extensive library of machine learning algorithms and tools to build and train my predictive model.

## Workflow
1. **Data Preparation:** Flight data is collected and preprocessed using BigQuery. Relevant features such as departure delay, distance, and carrier information are extracted for model training.

2. **Model Development:** A deep learning model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras. This model incorporates both linear and deep features to capture complex relationships in the data.

3. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained using Vertex AI, with hyperparameter tuning to optimize its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to assess the model's effectiveness. For example, the model achieved an accuracy of 80% and a recall of 75% on the validation set.

4. **Deployment as Endpoint:** Once the model is trained and evaluated, it is deployed as an endpoint on Vertex AI. This enables real-time predictions on incoming flight data, allowing airlines to proactively manage flight schedules and minimize delays.

## Conclusion
By leveraging GCP's advanced machine learning services such as Vertex AI, BigQuery, Docker, and TensorFlow, I have developed a robust and scalable solution for predicting flight delays. This project demonstrates the power of cloud-based machine learning platforms in addressing real-world challenges and delivering actionable insights to businesses.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating additional features such as weather data and airport congestion information to improve prediction accuracy.
- Exploring ensemble learning techniques to further enhance model performance.
- Implementing advanced monitoring and logging for the deployed model to ensure continuous optimization and reliability.
